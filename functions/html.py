            <h1> Detector Application</h1>
            <h2> About: </h2>
                This application is built with streamlit.
                It allows for three major ways of detection:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Detection by uploading image(s) </li>
                        <li> Detection by uploading video(s) </li>
                        <li> Detection using webcam </li>
                    </ul>
                The streamlit library is used for building the interface of the app.
                There are two major models(pre-trained) present in this project:
                        <ul>
                            <li>YOLOv3</li>
                            <li>YOLOv8</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Files and Folders:</h2>
                There are multiple files and folders in this project:
                <b>FOLDERS</b>
                    <b>functions</b>
                        This folder contains all the necessary individual functions of the app:
                            <ul>
                                <li>webcam</li>
                                    This function contains all the necessary codes for opening and displaying the detected images using webcam.
                                <li>video_upload</li>
                                    This function contains the codes for
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>uploading</li>
                                            <li>saving</li>
                                            <li>and detecting videos only</li>
                                        </ul>
                                <li>image_upload</li>
                                    This function contains the codes to upload and detect images.
                                <li>settings</li>
                                    This file contains the necessary settings needed for each functions written in the functions folder to avoid repetition.
                                <li>helper</li>
                                    This functions contains various functions that aids the main app file outside the functions folder.
                            </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>images</b></li>
                            This folder contains local images used for testing the app.
                        <li><b>weights</b></li>
                        This folder contains the different YOLO weights used in the project.
                        <li><b>uploaded_videos</b></li>
                        This is a `code` generated folder that will store the uploaded videos to be re-read for detection in the upload_video function.
                    </ul>
                    <b>FILES</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>main</b></li>
                            This is the main file that contains the streamlit interface code and the calling of the various functions in the functions folder.
                    </ul>
