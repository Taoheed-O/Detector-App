### Detector Application

#### About:

        This application is built with streamlit.
        It allows for three major ways of detection:
            * Detection by uploading image(s)
            * Detection by uploading video(s)
            * Detection using webcam
        The streamlit library is used for building the interface of the app.
        There are two major models(pre-trained) present in this project:
            - YOLOv3
            - YOLOv8

#### Files and Folders:

        There are multiple files and folders in this project:
        **FOLDERS**
            **functions**
                This folder contains all the necessary individual functions of the app:
                    - webcam
                        This function contains all the necessary codes for opening and displaying the detected images using webcam.
                    - video_upload
                        This function contains the codes for
                            - uploading
                            - saving
                            - and detecting videos only.
                    - image_upload
                        This function contains the codes to upload and detect images.
                    - settings
                        This file contains the necessary settings needed for each functions written in the functions folder to avoid repetition.
                    - helper
                        This functions contains various functions that aids the main app file outside the functions folder.

            **images**
                This folder contains local images used for testing the app.

            **weights**
                This folder contains the different YOLO weights used in the project.

            **uploaded_videos**
                This is a `code` generated folder that will store the uploaded videos to be re-read for detection in the upload_video function.

        **FILES**
            **main**
                This is the main file that contains the streamlit interface code and the calling of the various functions in the functions folder.

#### How to run

        * Fork the repository/ download the zip file.
        * Download the requirements from the requirements.txt file.
        * cd into the directory.
        * run the following command in your terminal/command prompt 'python -m streamlit run main.py'.
        * click on the link (localhost).
